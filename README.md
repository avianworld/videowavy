Bare bones VGA signal generation proof of concept using EBAZ4205 board with Xilinx Vivado. This only use the PL section of the chip

This is my first attempt at HDL - don't except anything fancy

Errata: The vertical active zone thing doesn't quite work yet. Horizontal works fine. 
Todo: Potentially do something with image buffer and rendering stuff
